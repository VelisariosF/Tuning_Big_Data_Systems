# Tuning_Big_Data_Systems
This reporistory contains code of the experiments that were conducted in order to implement the new systemtic tuning methodology for the Apache Spark System.
This new methodology was proposed to this thesis https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214579617300114.


#ABSTRACT
Nowadays the big data phenomenon known as the exponential growth of the amount of data that are daily being produced causes the imperative need of facing the problems that come with it,  such as the processing of those data in a fair amount of time. When it comes to processing them many data analysis systems have been introduced and one of them is Spark. Spark comes with many parameters and its appropriate configuration is the foundation of  completing its operations in a brief amount of time. But finding the appropriate configuration is a very time consuming problem and thus some methodologies that solve this problem must be presented. The goal of this thesis is to present two parameter tuning methodologies for Spark, apply them to some applications and also compare them when it comes to which one is better.
